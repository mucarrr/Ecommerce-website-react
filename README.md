# What I learned from this project

The key features of this project is using High Order Components (HOCs) to simplify and reuse common logic across multiple components. This learned me to make the code cleaner, more consistent, and easier to maintain.
With this project, I improved my skills in integrating APIs, managing state, using different libraries and building responsive and feature-rich web applications with React.
